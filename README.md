### Description: 

Settings Center is a customizable drop-down menu for quickly launching frequently used apps in Gnome:Shell via the quick settings menu. Originally created by XES. 

Settings shortcuts : gnome-tweak-tool, dconf-editor, gconf-editor, gnome-session-properties, gnome-shell-extension-prefs, seahorse and nvidia-settings. You can add your own

Original source : http://svn.xesnet.fr/gnomeextensions (3.8 replace Settings code credit IsacDaavid)

Credit to @peaceseeker for updating this with a working repo, i do wish it could have been pushed to me but my blank repo was deleted as it was stale, i failed to push to git before going back to work around 1.5 years ago and i hadn't been active enough to notice anything other than emails(these things help people!)


### TODO:
pull in changes for 3.10-3.16 from @peaceseeker _done_
add option to change current titles
as of 3.10 and up the aggregate menu (which i and mathematicalcoffee pushed designs for, without credits) is becoming cluttered so the following line needs to be considered heavily:
create own button and merge pa-shorcuts, eventually... anything being added to the aggreate menu now needs to be done in a reasonable fashion matching gnome hig.


### 1 click install from E.G.O:

_this is not the fork, of my fork of XES' original work, by vistaus, who never attempted to contact me to update this. i am not, nor do i represent, vistaus_
